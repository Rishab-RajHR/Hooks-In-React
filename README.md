React Hooks allow you to use state and lifecycle features in functional components.

Introduced in React 16.8 to simplify component logic.

useState is used to manage local component state.

useEffect handles side effects like data fetching and subscriptions.

useContext helps consume context without prop drilling.

useRef provides mutable references without re-rendering.

useReducer manages complex state logic efficiently.

Hooks must be called at the top level of a component.

They cannot be used inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.

Hooks improve code reusability, readability, and maintainability.
